8. What are the subsets of SQL?
SQL queries are divided into four main categories:

Data Definition Language (DDL)
DDL queries are made up of SQL commands that can be used to define the structure of the database and modify it.
CREATE Creates databases, tables, schema, etc.
DROP: Drops tables and other database objects
DROP COLUMN: Drops a column from any table structure
ALTER: Alters the definition of database objects
TRUNCATE: Removes tables, views, procedures, and other database objects
ADD COLUMN: Adds any column to the table schema
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
These SQL queries are used to manipulate data in a database.
SELECT INTO: Selects data from one table and inserts it into another
INSERT: Inserts data or records into a table
UPDATE: Updates the value of any record in the database
DELETE: Deletes records from a table
Data Control Language (DCL)
These SQL queries manage the access rights and permission control of the database.
GRANT: Grants access rights to database objects
REVOKE: Withdraws permission from database objects
Transaction Control Language (TCL)
TCL is a set of commands that essentially manages the transactions in a database and the changes made by the DML statements. TCL allows statements to be grouped together into logical transactions.
COMMIT: Commits an irreversible transaction, i.e., the previous image of the database prior to the transaction cannot be retrieved
ROLLBACK: Reverts the steps in a transaction in case of an error
SAVEPOINT: Sets a savepoint in the transaction to which rollback can be executed
SET TRANSACTION: Sets the characteristics of the transaction
